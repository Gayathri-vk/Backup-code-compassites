               Unlike any other Project Management software,our main source of data is recorded from the tender
               <bold>Bill Of Quantities(BOQ)</bold> with its COST that are usually prepared by the quantity surveyors during
               the tender stage. This tender BOQ with quantity and COST is being scheduled with the project timline
               as per the contract duration which is stored under one MUST cloud platform as Base Programme. In this 
               Base Programme <bold>the actual site progress</bold>is recorded and compared with the scheduled 
               timeline on a daily basis.Apart from monitoring this Base Programme,we also have provision in MUST
               365 COST MANAGEMENT innosoft to record and monitor all the <bold>Variation Orders or Scope Change Authorisations</bold>  
               issued by the Consultants.This unique process signifies the importance of having <bold><q>ONE DATA & MULTIPLE USERS</q></bold>
               saving loss of data,time and resources for the project.
             </li>
             <li>
               This Base Programme is monitored and compared to that of the Actual Work completed by end of each day
               of work and it can be made available to anybody from anywhere on the device,which is very unique
               for sharing and discussion purpose through companies secured used id and passwords.This process
               signifies the importance of identifying those activates that are being delayed on a daily basis
               and hence it is very much informative and useful to address or mitigate the delays at a very early
               stage avoiding late completion of those activites and its preceding activates and its COST implications.

               Since MUST 365 COST MANAGEMENT innosoft is a cloud-based application,all the stored ONE data
               can be seamlessly made available to all other departments like Purchasing,Accounting,Logistic,Subcontractor,
               Supplier,etc.to schedule and plan their respective work timely and efficiently.
